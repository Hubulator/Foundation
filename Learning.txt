CSC - (Caascading Style Sheets)

We need three things:
    1. Structure = HTML
    2. Style = CSS
    3. Functionality = JS

Three ways that we can apply CSS properties to HTML:
    1. Inline
    2. Internal
    3. External (works the best for large websites)

External style sheets are really useful since we css allows us to 
    target any specific element by id or a class tthat they may be in
    any element that has these ames will have these styles.

            We can also target anything within the same calss: it is like a group.


To change the font family there is a font family property

CSS allows us to change the background color,
    Set a linear gradient 
    Set an image as our background


CSS Media Queries 

    Media queries allow you modify your site based on specific 
    characteristics and paramters (most often viewd in the web browser viewport)

    This is key to responsive design as our web pages will respond to the width of device viewport

        Syntax:

            @media media type and (condition: breakpoint) {
             // CSS rules
            }

    Mobile first design 
    Designing from the smallest to the largest
    (One colunm design)

                Example:
                                /* starting from = min-width */
                                @media screen and (min-width: 481px) {
                                    /* CSS rules */
                                } 

        Remember to download extension: Markdown all in one 
        To preview the markdown:
        Crlt + shift + v

Meeting 3:

Static Site Generators (SSG)
    SSGs convert templates and content (e.g., Markdown) into a complete website ahead of time. 
        This makes your site fast and easy to host.

    Chosen SSG: Eleventy (11ty)
    - Supports templating (Nunjucks)
    - Easy integration of layouts and partials
    - Markdown friendly

---

Templating Languages
    Templating lets you reuse parts of your site like 
        headers, footers, or navigation.

    Using Nunjucks with Eleventy, you can:
    - Create a base layout
    - Include header/footer
    - Insert dynamic content (like page title)

---

CSS Units: From `px` to `rem`, `em`
    Using relative units makes the site responsive:

    - `rem`: based on root font size (e.g. 1rem = 16px)
    - `em`: based on parent font size
    - `%`: based on parent container
    - `vw`/`vh`: based on screen dimensions

**Example**:
```css
h1 {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  margin: 1rem;
}
