CSC - (Caascading Style Sheets)

We need three things:
    1. Structure = HTML
    2. Style = CSS
    3. Functionality = JS

Three ways that we can apply CSS properties to HTML:
    1. Inline
    2. Internal
    3. External (works the best for large websites)

External style sheets are really useful since we css allows us to 
    target any specific element by id or a class tthat they may be in
    any element that has these ames will have these styles.

            We can also target anything within the same calss: it is like a group.
