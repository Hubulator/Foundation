CSC - (Caascading Style Sheets)

We need three things:
    1. Structure = HTML
    2. Style = CSS
    3. Functionality = JS

Three ways that we can apply CSS properties to HTML:
    1. Inline
    2. Internal
    3. External (works the best for large websites)

External style sheets are really useful since we css allows us to 
    target any specific element by id or a class tthat they may be in
    any element that has these ames will have these styles.

            We can also target anything within the same calss: it is like a group.


To change the font family there is a font family property

CSS allows us to change the background color,
    Set a linear gradient 
    Set an image as our background


CSS Media Queries 

    Media queries allow you modify your site based on specific 
    characteristics and paramters (most often viewd in the web browser viewport)

    This is key to responsive design as our web pages will respond to the width of device viewport

        Syntax:

            @media media type and (condition: breakpoint) {
             // CSS rules
            }
