<h2>Welcome to Foundation</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Foundation</strong> is a tool designed to help incoming Computer Science students 
  build confidence in algebra, trigonometry, and geometry as a strong 
  foundation for success in Calculus I, II, and III.
</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
  My name is <strong>GraceAnna Akparanta</strong>, and I am studying Computer Science at 
  the CUNY College of Staten Island. I created this project because I noticed 
  that many students were leaving the major due to challenges in mathematics. 
  My goal is to provide a supportive resource that makes math less intimidating 
  and helps students continue their journey in computer science.
</p>

<h3>Why This Project?</h3>
<p>
  This site was created as part of the <strong>Coding It Forward: Discovery Program</strong>. 
  During the program, students were encouraged to create a deliverable that 
  contributes to the public interest. I chose to build this webpage to support 
  my peers and future students who may struggle with math. 
  I believe making STEM education more accessible is a form of 
  <em>public interest technology</em>.
</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>
  I would like to thank my mentor for their guidance, patience, and encouragement 
  throughout this process. Their support has been invaluable, and this project 
  would not have been possible without their insights.
